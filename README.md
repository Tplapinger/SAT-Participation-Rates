# Project 1: SAT Scores + Summary Statistics

### Overview
We are taking a look at SAT scores around the United States. We'll be exploring this data to see what we can learn using the descriptive statistics skills covered this week.

**Goal**: A Jupyter notebook that describes your data with visualizations & statistical analysis.

**Goal**: A five to seven minute presentation targeted to your hypothetical client that highlights your findings.

### Requirements

Your work must:

- Describe your data
- Perform methods of exploratory data analysis, including:
  - Use Matplotlib to create visualizations
  - Use NumPy to apply basic summary statistics: mean, median, mode
- Determine if the dataset appears to follow a normal distribution

---

### Starter code

For this project we will be using a Jupyter notebook. This notebook will use matplotlib
for plotting and visualizing our data. This type of visualization is handy for prototyping
and quick data analysis. We will discuss more advanced data visualizations for disseminating your work.

Open the [starter code instructions](./code/) in a Jupyter notebook.

### Dataset

- [Dataset: SAT Scores](./data/sat_scores.csv)

This data, taken from the College Board, gives the mean SAT math(s) and verbal scores, and the participation rate for each state and the District of Columbia for the year 2001.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Read in your dataset.
- Try out a few NumPy commands to describe your data.
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.  
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success!
- Document **everything**.

Be sure to rehearse and time your presentation before class.
